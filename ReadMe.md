# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Factory Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Factory plugin manufactures a new plugin which then replaces the factory. A variety of user interactions trigger the manufacturing of a new plugin.
